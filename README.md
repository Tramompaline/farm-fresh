<u>**Testing:**</u>

I have confirmed that this site works on Chrome, Firefox and Edge browsers. 

I have confirmed that the site is responsive across the common display sizes.

I have confirmed that social media links in the footer are clickable and working correctly.

I have confirmed that the sign up form is functioning as expected. Form will not submit if fields are left blank or an invalid email address is used. Form submits data correctly as expected. 


<u>**Bugs:**</u>

Issues with layout on larger display sizes were solved by tweaking CSS style rules for media queries. This was done for 728px, 992px and 1200px size displays.

Home page text color on mobile display was showing incorrectly. This was solved by reviewing the code, ensuring that the text color was clearly defined and that no later code sections could override it.


Page was deployed to GitHub pages.
