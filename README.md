# Farm Fresh Website
Welcome to the [Farm Fresh](https://tramompaline.github.io/farm-fresh/signup.html) website! This site is for a local farmers market where customers can purchase a wide variety of locally grown fresh farm products directly from farmers themselves. The website features a welcoming home page, testimonials from customers and farmers about the value of the farmers market and a sign-up form for users to join the Farm Fresh community and keep up to date with news and events.

<u>**Design and Styling Choices for Farm Fresh Farmers Market Website:**</u>

<u>Color Scheme:</u>

The Farm Fresh Farmers Market website utilizes a warm, earthy colour palette to reflect the natural and organic nature of the products offered. Accents of goldenrod are used to highlight important elements, adding a touch of brightness and warmth.

<u>Typography:</u>

The site features clean, readable text, with a combination of serif and sans-serif fonts. The serif fonts are used for headings and titles to give a traditional and trustworthy feel, while sans-serif fonts are used for body text to ensure readability and modernity.

<u>Layout:</u>

The layout is responsive and user-friendly, designed to work seamlessly across all devices. The structure is simple and intuitive, with a clear hierarchy that guides users through the content. Key sections such as the homepage, market user testimonials and newsletter signup form are easily accessible from the navigation menu. A transparent background on text sections allows for the bakground image colours to show through while maintaining the highest level of readability.

<u>Navigation:</u>

A checkbox-based navigation toggle is implemented for mobile devices, enhancing the user experience by providing an unobtrusive and accessible menu. The hamburger icon, styled with a goldenrod colour, indicates the menu toggle, ensuring it is noticeable and inviting for users to interact with.

<u>Imagery:</u>

A high quality background image of fresh produce is used throughout the site to create a visually appealing and engaging experience. The image not only enhances the aesthetic appeal but also helps in conveying the essence of the farmers market.

<u>Testimonials:</u>

A selection of testimonials from farmers market customers and producers helps to convey the value and sense of community that the market provides. 

<u>Form Styling:</u>

The signup form is styled with simplicity and clarity in mind. Input fields and buttons are well-spaced and clearly labeled, ensuring ease of use for all visitors. The form also requires inputs for name fields and a valid email address ensuring that a blank form cannot be returned.

<u>Buttons and Links:</u>

Buttons and links are styled consistently with a focus on usability. Primary buttons are highlighted with the goldenrod colour, while secondary buttons and links maintain the site's overall colour scheme. Hover effects are used to provide feedback and enhance interactivity.

<u>Overall Aesthetic:</u>

The overall aesthetic of the Farm Fresh Farmers Market website is clean, fresh, and welcoming. The design choices reflect the market's commitment to providing fresh, locally sourced produce and creating a community-focused environment. The use of natural colours, intuitive navigation, and engaging imagery all contribute to a positive and memorable user experience.
